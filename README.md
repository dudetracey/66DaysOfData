# 66DaysOfData
Documenting my journey on 66 days of data


## Day 1:
Put my plans together for the class that I'm taking. I'll be taking the class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" on Udemy.

## Day 2:
Today I set up the Jupiter Notebooks and Anaconda. Feels like there are a million different programs that exist within the computer world just for working with computers and that is kind of overwhelming. I'll make more progress on Day 3.

## Day 3:
I learned about virtual environments and how to use the Anaconda Terminal!

## Day 4:
A few minutes in the Python Crash Course

## Day 5:
Big takeaways on Python Crash Course
### You can use the {} to make writing out saved variable data much easier. Example:
num = 23
name = Dude
print("Your name is {} and you ate {} hot dogs.".format(name,num))

That will print out "Your name is Dude and you ate 23 hot dogs."

### You can use multiple [] to call a list nested within a list.
list = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
list[2][1] would be the 4 inside of that list

### Quick reminders and differences:
list = []
Can append stuff to them or call out values or rewrite values

tupples = ()
Immutable = cannot change any values set in them

dictionary = {'key':'value'}
Need to map a key to a value (just like input to output in math). They are always key value pairs.

set = {}
These will only contain unique values so they eliminate any repeating values. (Not useful in data where you probably want to keep repeating values). These are each one value usually unlike a dictionary which maps one key to one value.

### List comprehension:
I've struggled with this in the past. The goal of using it is to skip extra for loops and using the append function. Just make the new list in one line of code.
Grab everything in the first line (the for loop) and paste it at the end of a line in brackets.
Grab whatever you want to append and put it in the first part of the brackets before the for loop.
That should work.

## Day 6
Continuing Python basics.
### Functions: I have been confused in previous coding on how to set up the initial def line.
Examples:
def my_func(name):
  print('Hello '+name)
my_func('Jose')
(Runs to give you "Hello Jose")
*Default value*
def my_func(name='Default Name'):
  print('Hello '+name)
 my_func('Jose')
 (Runs "Hello Jose" or else if there was no Jose then it would say "Hello Default Name")
 
 ### When do you use return?
 If you need to store a new value (for example, a function that squares the input) and then use that value or print it later, then you will return. If all you need to do is print something without storing it, then you don't need return.
 
 ### Documentation: During a function, you can use """ to block off comments about the function and describe what it is doing. It can include multiple lines"""
 Use shift+tab to find out what the documentation string is. Can be done to the functions I build or to other functions inside the base of python. (Like range function in python then shift+tab)
 
 ### Lambda expressions:
 They are used when you want to do a function one time and don't really need to spend lines defining a function you barely use. Example:
 You want to take a list and multiple all the elements in it by 3
 seq = [1,2,3,4,5]
 list(map(lambda num: num\*3, seq))
 The output here would be the list [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]

## Day 7
Spent 10 minutes reviewing methods

## Day 8
Today I completed the first set of exercises for the course. I made a few syntax errors, but mainly I got through them easily. 
One question I am leaving for the next day is to figure out how 'pass' can be used in the final problem, which asked me to build a function that utilizes a lot of if/elif/else statements.

## Day 9
I spent an hour today going over the Python crash course answers, then jumped straight into Numpy.
Big takeaway from the answers on Python exercises: I still love to make too many variables and shift to a new variable each time I do a method or change data in some way. I imagine that is a natural part of programming is you become more efficient so the functions that take me six lines now will eventually only take one or two lines.
Numpy: so many cool ways to make data similar to what I learned in college linear algebra. The most fun I had learning all day (and I'm in my first week of a new job right now). I jumped straight into the exercises so I could practice the basic syntax right away with the types of random, the types of arrays you can make, and made lots of silly beginner errors along the way. Super fun hour overall.

## Day 10
Not much time spent, less than 20 min on Numpy array indexing. Will probably need to rewatch some of the notes in order to put them into practice.
Key takeaway: updating one version of an array will update the original array. Need to use the copy method to make a separate array that won't be updated when you update one version of an array.

## Day 11
Super short time today, learned the two ways to pull a single entry from a matrix with either [][] or [,]. Remember that we always start counting index positions from zero!

## Day 12
Another short study day. I learned about boolean arrays as a means of creating an array with certain values. I'm very curious to see why and how this is used in a future day of studying.

## Day 13
Another short day. Started numpy operations.

## Day 14
I was very surprised today while studying numpy operations to see the trig functions mentioned. I then built an array to spend some time playing around to figure out if they were in degrees or radians. (They're in radians). Then I had to mess around with trying to call up pi in the Jupyter notebook, but didn't succeed. I'm going to let it be for now.

## Day 15
Today I worked through the second half of the Numpy exercises (I did the first half on Day 9). The most surprising problem was one that used the axis. I guess the axis = 0 or 1 depending on rows/columns. So you can add all the columns of a matrix (called mat) with mat.sum(axis=0). I'll be starting with Pandas tomorrow.

## Day 16
Installed pandas and followed along with a lecture on Series. Interesting that they look like x,y pairs (and work very well with dictionaries that also look like them) but are in the opposite order for data and index inside the function compared to what is listed when you print it out.

## Day 17
Big jump into Data Frames! I am enjoying the deeper and deeper dives into working with data in what looks like a matrix (but is actually a combination of series to make a data frame). The instructor did a great job of showing how to write the same filtered information either in one line of code or multiple lines of code, which is something I notice is happening when I compare my code to answer keys in exercises. That was super helpful.

## Day 18
Spent an hour doing more in depth functions with Pandas. There is a lot of new info being thrown at me, some of it looking familiar to things I've done with math or excel, but most is brand new. I'm hoping to really dive into some practice problems in the next few days so I can check how well I'm picking up all this new info.

## Day 19
Short intro to operations in pandas today.

## Day 20
Continued my study of pandas operations.

## Day 21
Walked through an entry level overview of Pandas Data Input and Output. I was kind of blown away at how easy it is to export a data table into an excel file that I can actually open on my computer. Excited to see where I can take all these data ideas next as the next few days will all be working on various exercises.

## Day 22
Working through some pandas exercises. Finally starting to put the pieces together.

## Day 23
Continuing Pandas exercises

## Day 24
Currently, I am completely stuck on Pandas problems. I'll be looking at solutions tomorrow since I don't see hints anywhere to try to get unstuck on my own.

## Day 25
Reviewing answers to Pandas exercises I've completed

## Day 26
Really frustrated looking through solutions to the next few pandas problems. No idea how I'm supposed to put together this many syntax things on my own. Going to dedicate some more time to reviewing this ASAP.

## Day 27
Finished the first round of exercises and solutions and trying to apply what I've gained to the next set of exercises.

## Day 28
Got through most of the exercsises in the second section of the Pandas exercises. Felt way better about them the second time around as I was using similar examples from the first set to compare the main syntax. Excited to wrap them up tomorrow!

## Day 29
Super excited to say that I solved a tough problem that I totally got stuck on yesterday. I also solved it in a slightly different way than what was shown in the answer key! Hooray!

## Day 30
Reviewed solutions to the most recent set of exercises including alternate answers to how I wrote the code.

## Day 31
Finished the pandas section. Moving on to MatPlotLib tomorrow!

## Day 32
First day with Matplotlib, got to see plots built both with functions and OO. OO was way better.

## Day 33
Woohoo half way through! Continued matplotlib today

## Day 34
Continued matplotlib, working through file size and dpi details.

## Day 35
More matplotlib

## Day 36
How to change color and style of graphs in matplotlib, hopefully starting exercises tomorrow!

## Day 37
Finished matplotlib notes, was unable to start the excercises. Will start on Day 38.

## Day 38
Finished half of the matplotlib exercises!

## Day 39
Essentially finished the matplotlib exercises, had a very strange issue in one at the end that I'll need to try to understand tomorrow.

## Day 40
Completed the review of matplotlib solutions, found the error I made yesterday.

## Day 41
Began my study of Seaborn!

## Day 42
Made some new plots in Seaborn

## Day 43
Completed the distribution plots lesson in Seaborn, learned about kernel density estimation!

## Day 44
I'm now 2/3 of the way through this daily practice! Today I was studying categorical plots in Seaborn, got to make a box and whisker plot with a data set dividing tips from a restaurant up by day and by whether the customer was a smoker or not.

## Day 45
Completed the categorical plots lecture for seaborn, made some new types of graphs I'd never seen before!

## Day 46
A quick study of matrix plots, they were super cool. 

## Day 47
I looked at grids in Seaborn, kind of a weird combination of things I have learned in Seaborn so far.

## Day 48
I found out how to make linear regression lines in Seaborn and adjust the size and style. I will start doing some independent exercises tomorrow!

## Day 49
I made quite a few sample graphs in Seaborn using the famous Titanic dataset. I'm looking forward to comparing my graphs to a more sophisticated set of solutions tomorrow!

## Day 50
Today I reviewed solutions to several Seaborn graphing exercises. I made a few errors in setting up a FacetGrid, but the rest were very precise! 

## Day 51
Data visualization in Pandas - it is simple, but not as customizable as Seaborn.

## Day 52
Tried exercises for data visualization in Pandas. The basic formatting is easy, but every customization is a matter of looking up examples and googling. I feel like a real programmer right now.

## Day 53
I fixed a few errors in the exercises and went over their solutions. I have one problem left and then will move on!

## Day 54
Today was a day of doing some problem solving with Google and Stack Overflow. I had a viable solution to my main problem of the day, so that's a win!

## Day 55:
Plotly and Cufflinks crash course! Super fun to look at the different types of interactive plots!

## Day 56
My first day of geographical plotting with Choropleth maps. Pretty intense details to put together, but really cool results to see the whole graph populated.

## Day 57
Ran through another example of a chorpleth map from plotly. I'll be trying some exercises on my own tomorrow.

## Day 58
I built some plots on my own today with choropleths. Feels really rewarding to see the data fill out the maps!

## Day 59
I reviewed the exercise solutions today. The big takeaway was that using a color scale with "reversescale = True" often makes it easier to visually interpret the graphs (and they look prettier, too).

## Day 60
First day of trying to put all the pieces together to answer basic questions for a set of 911 call data from Kaggle.

## Day 61
I spent my programming time today trying and failing to add a column to a data frame that split out parts of the data in a preexisting column. I look up a solution to it tomorrow.

## Day 62
Found out I was incredibly close on how to add the next columns to the data frame. Continued the data project of 911 calls.

## Day 63
Continued working with 911 call data. I created additional columns in my data frame with time and date data and created a few graphs based on those values as the x axis. Will continue to work with hourly data tomorrow.

## Day 64
I continue to wrestle with making many different graphs using the 911 call data. Manipulating the dataframe by grouping a new index and using that to create different types of plots was very difficult to do, but it felt very relieving to succeed.
